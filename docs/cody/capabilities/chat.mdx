# Chat

<p className="subtitle">Use Cody's chat to get contextually-aware answers to your questions.</p>

Cody **chat** allows you to ask coding-related questions about your entire codebase or a specific code snippet. You can do it from the **Chat** panel of the supported editor extensions (VS Code, JetBrains, and Neovim) or in the web app.

Key functionalities in the VS Code extension include support for multiple simultaneous chats, enhanced chat context configurability through `@` commands, detailed visibility into the code that Cody read before providing a response, and more.

You can learn more about the IDE support for these functionalities in the [feature parity reference](/cody/clients/feature-reference#chat).

## Prerequisites

To use Cody's chat, you'll need to have the following:

- A Free or Pro account via Sourcegraph.com or a Sourcegraph Enterprise account
- A supported editor extension (VS Code, JetBrains, and Neovim) installed

## How does chat work?
<HowChatWorks />

## Ask Cody your first question
Let's use Cody VS Code extension's chat interface to answer your first question.

- Click the Cody icon in the sidebar to view the detailed panel
- Next, click the icon for **New Chat** to open a new chat window
- Write your question or instruction to Cody and then press **Enter**.

For example, ask Cody "What does this file do?"

Cody will take a few seconds to process your question, providing contextual information about the files it reads and generating the answer.

## Ask Cody to write code

## Selecting Context

### Chat vs Commands

There could be scenarios when Cody's chat might not be able to answer your question. Or the answer lacks the context that you need. In these cases, it's recommended to use Cody **commands**. Cody's responses to commands might be better at times than responses to chats since they've been pre-packaged and prompt-engineered.

<Callout type="note"> Commands are only supported in the VS Code and JetBrains extension.</Callout>
