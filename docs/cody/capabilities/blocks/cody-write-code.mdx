The chat feature can also write code for your questions. For example, in VS Code, ask Cody to "write a function that sorts an array in ascending order".

You are provided with code suggestions in the chat window along with the following options for using the code.

- The **Copy Code** icon to your clipboard and paste the code suggestion into your code editor
- Insert the code suggestion at the current cursor location by the **Insert Code at Cursor** icon
- The **Save Code to New File** icon to save the code suggestion to a new file in your project

During the chat, if Cody needs additional context, it can ask you to provide more information with a follow-up question. If your question is beyond the scope of the context, Cody will ask you to provide an alternate question aligned with the context of your codebase.
