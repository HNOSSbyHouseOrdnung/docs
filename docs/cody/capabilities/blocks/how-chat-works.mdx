Cody can use several methods (including keyword search and optional embeddings context) to ask relevant questions. For VS Code extension users, Cody also uses context from the files to provide an informed response based on your codebase. Cody also tells you which code files it reads to generate its responses.

Cody can assist you with various use cases such as:

- Generating an API call: Cody can analyze your API schema to provide context for the code it generates
- Locating a specific component in your codebase: Cody can identify and describe the files where a particular component is defined
- Handling questions that involve multiple files, like understanding data population in a React app: Cody can locate React component definitions, helping you understand how data is passed and where it originates
