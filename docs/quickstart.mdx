# Sourcegraph Getting Started Guide

<p className= "subtitle">Sourcegraph is your Code Search and AI Coding Assistant tool. These docs will help you get onboarded with the Sourcegraph platform and our products.</p>

## Sourcegraph capabilities

- **Search** across all Omniverse code (all code hosts, repos, branches, commits, and diffs)
- **Navigate** code (go to definition, find references, etc.) with IDE-like precision across all Omniverse repos
- **Automate** large-scale code changes across repos (update config files, patch vulns, etc.)
- **Track** migrations, adoption/deprecation, versions, etc., by creating customizable, visual dashboards to track what you'd like within Omniverse's codebase
- **Write and fix** code faster with Cody's AI completions
- **Ask questions** of Cody to get answers about your codebase
- **Get alerts** for code changes (reintroduction of anti-patterns, etc.)
- **Document** your code with live and persistent Notebooks that are shareable with your organization
